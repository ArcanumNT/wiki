## Major trophies info and their effects
Once you collected every Minor trophy, you can exchange them for one Major trophy.
A Major trophy can be upgraded three times.
Upon receiving one Major trophy, you can randomly get one of the three upgrades:

Tier 1 (has r6 colour)
Tier 2 (has r7 colour)
Tier 3 (has r8 colour)

Major trophies can be upgraded with a **Trophy Upgrade** item ![](https://i.imgur.com/VdsanI5.png) which you can buy from Nemo (NosVille, next to level 1 Time-Space). This item is expensive on purpose, since trophies are considered activities for later in the game, and also a gold sink.
With every upgrade, the stats of the Major tropy increases.
