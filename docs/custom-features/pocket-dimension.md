# Pocket Dimensions

Pocket dimensions were introduced to permit people to farm spots without having to fight/insult to decide who is on the spot.

They can be found on different maps, and you can choose entering to them alone or as a Team.

## Restrictions
- As a team, all the group members need to be on the same map.
- Once you created a Pocket Dimension, there is a **15 minutes cooldown** to create a new one.
- Pocket Dimensions are destroyed when no one is on the map for 5 seconds.

These restrictions are subject to change.
