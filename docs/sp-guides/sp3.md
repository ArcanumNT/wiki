## SP3 - Questline
Like the SP1 and SP2 Questlines, their TimeSpaces are gone but unlike the other two SP Questlines are not replaced by killing monsters. So it is just shortened and also some of the needed item amounts were reduced. Another change is, that everything has a 100% droprate.

In case of accidentally deleting a quest item, you can buy them again from the treasure box next to the Soulstone for 1kk each as seen below:
