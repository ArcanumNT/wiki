# Specialist Guide - SP1

One of the many quality of life changes introduced to Olympus is the different Questlines for the Specialists 1 through 4. These changes were made to shorten the time needed to aquire the Specialists and also give the Player a smoother game experience.

## Where to find the Soulstone
You can find the Sp1 Soulstone on the marked place in **Fernon Outpost**.

## SP1 - Questline
Talk to the Red Soulstone and accept the Quest. Don't talk to it again since you do not have to do the TimeSpaces here, instead you will be tasked to slay different monsters in the **Fernon Outpost** map.
1. Kill 10 **Ram** and 10 **Grasmandra**.

This was the whole SP1 Questline , now without the TimeSpaces it will take you approximately 5 to 10 minutes.
