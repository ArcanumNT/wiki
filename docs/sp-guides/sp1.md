# Specialist Guide - SP1

One of the many Quality of Life changes introduced to Olympus is the different Questlines for the Specialists 1 through 4. These changes were made to shorten the time needed to aquire the Specialists and also give the Player a smoother game experience.

## Where to find the Soulstone
You can find the SP1 Soulstone on the marked place in **Fernon Outpost**.

## SP1 - Questline
Talk to the Red Soulstone and accept the Quest. Don't talk to it again since you do not have to do the Time-Spaces here, instead you will be tasked to slay different monsters in the **Fernon Outpost** map.
1. Kill 10 **Ram** and 10 **Grasmandra**.
