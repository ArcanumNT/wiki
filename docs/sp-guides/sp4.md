## SP4 - Questline
Like the other SP-Questlines, the TimeSpaces are gone but unlike the first two Sp Questlines are not replaced my killing monsters. So it is just shortened and also some of the needed monster kill counts were reduced. Another change is, that everything has a 100% droprate.
In case of accidently deleting a quest item, you can buy them again from the treasure box next to the Soulstone for 1kk.
