# QoL - Mass Crafting

Olympus brought another QoL change, the Mass Crafting. With it you can produce as many items as you want with only one click - as long as you have enough materials - not only minimizing time needed for crafting but also rewarding you with lesser production cost.

## Mass Refiner
You will first come into contact with it, while interacting with Malcom Mix in his shop he now has 4 new Items you can buy:

We will first look at the "Mass Refiner". These Items cost 5k each and will refine 10 Gillion Stones at once into their respective materials e.g. cellons, moon crystals and soul gems.

The way these work is, if you would get a refined item you will get 10x of them at once, so dont be shocked when you don't always get a refined item.
Here is how it will look ingame:

## Moon Mass Production
The next item is the "Prodction Tool for Plenty of Moons". This item costs 500k at Malcom Mix and you can craft 100 of Half-and Fullmoons at once, hence the 500k cost.

As you can see on the right side with the Mass Crafting feature it will automatically show how many materials it will need to craft 300 half moons at once, sothat you don't have to craft it individually 3 times which will save time in the long run.

## Snack, Potion and Food Mass Production
One of the newest NosVille Residents is Remy, the Little Chef. With Remy's help you can craft snacks, food and potions on mass as you can see here:

## SP5 and SP6 Mass Production
The next NPCs at ,which you can use Mass Crafting are Great Magician Khan and Felix Frost in Desert Eagle City:

As you can see both NPCs trade their respective Seals, Perfection Stones and Upgrade materials in bulk with the Mass Crafting function, so no more hassle of clicking or spamming production.
