# Equipment Crafting and Progression Guide

## Lvls 83 to 85 gear
With the A1 quest finished you should be lv83. Now go to Teoman and buy yourself the 83 Desertrobber EQ from him. This will last you until 85 where you can get the A3 Lv85 weapons. These you can spam bet at Teodor e.g. buy --> rare --> fail/succeed rinse and repeat until you get a decent shell for pve. The Lvl 85 gear should last you until the 90 gear.

## Lvl 90 gear
There are 3 ways to get the Lv90 gear:
1. Now with a very high chance of getting the mysterious relic from the ibra chest you will most likely get your whole set in less than 7 raids and trade pieces which you do not need with other players.

2. If you choose to level with 5.1 your efforts will not be unrewarded. Doing the whole 5.1 questline will net you around 40kk and enough Gold Coins needed for a whole set which are 22 Gold Coins.
3. The last option is Commander Camp farming e.g. Neil/Melki/Keru/Garton Camp. With the new 2.5% chance for a Gold Coin to drop you can get a full set relatively quickly.

## Lvl 92/93 gear
This gear you will get as usual from their respective Raid Boxes.  
Raid boxes are always r4+ and shelled if you open the box and get gear.

## Lvl 95/96 gear 
As usual this gear will be craftable from the 92/93 set, though the materials needed are changed as seen below. The materials needed will be the same for all classes, so 1 whole set needs 70 each of Hot Metal and Wood for the weapons and 35 each of Hot Leather and Fabric for the armor.
